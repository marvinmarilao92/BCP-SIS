The researchers come up with the idea of creating a Document approval and Tracking Management System, to have a reliable and smooth process of approval and tracking of documents in the office of the registrar of Bestlink College of the Philippines. The system needs to manage and track the documents for the users to know if the document is still pending, ongoing, outgoing, received, or held by the sender or the receiver. The Bestlink College of the Philippines experience lots of problem in terms of slow and unreliable document tracking, in terms of manual procedure, the registrar staff tends to have a really hard time looking for a specific document, and it misspend a huge amount of time and effort, but with the use of the Document Approval and Tracking Management System users will now be able to identify where the document is located and who is the person currently handled it. The main objective of the researchers is to create a system that will help the registrar employees to complete their work faster by using an automated system instead of an old and inadequate manual process.
